1. Set up Jasmine.
2. Considering that we want to create a function that counts the number of words in a string:
   1. Create at least 2 jasmine tests considering the following:
      1. Test if the count result is the expected one
      2. Test if no argument is passed to the function
      3. When an argumento is passed, check if is a string
   2. Create the function
   3. Refactor, if needed
